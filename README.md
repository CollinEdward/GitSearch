# GitSearch
This script is a Python program that utilizes the Tkinter library to create a graphical user interface (GUI) for searching GitHub repositories based on a user's query. It retrieves repository data from the GitHub API, displays the results in a text widget, and allows the user to open a repository's URL in a web browser.
